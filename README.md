<h1>Simple Weather Web App</h1>

This repository contains a basic weather web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can enter a city name, click a search button, and the app retrieves weather information for that location from the OpenWeatherMap API.

Features:

User input for city name
Search button to fetch weather data
Displays current weather information (temperature, conditions, icon)
Potentially expandable to include additional weather details (optional)
Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/newtonfrank>/simple-weather-app.git

```

Use code with caution.

Install dependencies (optional):

If you're using a package manager like npm, you can install any dependencies (e.g., CSS frameworks) listed in a package.json file. However, for a simple HTML/CSS/JS app, this step may not be necessary.

Obtain an OpenWeatherMap API key:

Create a free account on OpenWeatherMap.org.
Navigate to your API keys page and generate a new key.
Replace config.MY_API_KEY in the JavaScript code with your actual API key.
Running the Application:

Open index.html in your web browser.
How it Works:

The HTML structure defines the basic layout of the app, including input fields, buttons, and display areas.
CSS styles provide visual design to the app's elements.
JavaScript handles user interaction (search button click) and fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API using the provided API key. It then parses the JSON response and displays relevant weather information on the screen.
Customization (Optional):

You can customize the HTML structure and CSS styling to match your preferences.
The JavaScript code can be extended to display additional weather details (e.g., humidity, wind speed, forecast) based on the OpenWeatherMap API response.
